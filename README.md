## Recent Improvements

This project has been significantly enhanced with security and code quality improvements:

### 🔒 Security Enhancements
- **Fixed critical security vulnerability** in model loading by using `weights_only=True` for `torch.load`
- **Removed public exposure** of Gradio interface (`share=False`) to prevent accidental public access
- **Added comprehensive input validation** for all user inputs with regex pattern matching
- **Enhanced resource management** with proper cleanup and warning systems

### 🛠️ Code Quality Improvements
- **Replaced hardcoded values** with named constants for better maintainability
- **Added comprehensive type hints** throughout the codebase for better IDE support and safety
- **Enhanced thread safety** with proper locking mechanisms for concurrent operations
- **Improved error handling** with specific error types and consistent messaging
- **Added proper warning suppression** for model-related deprecation warnings

### 📁 New Components
- **`config.py`** - Centralized configuration management system
- **`dependency_checker.py`** - Comprehensive dependency validation and CUDA detection
- **`IMPROVEMENTS.md`** - Detailed documentation of all enhancements

For complete details, see [`IMPROVEMENTS.md`](IMPROVEMENTS.md).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- FFmpeg (optional, for MP3/AAC conversion)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster generation)
- Git (for version control and package management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Alternative Installation (Simplified):**
For a simpler setup, you can also install the official Kokoro package directly:
```bash
pip install kokoro soundfile
apt-get install espeak-ng  # On Linux
# or brew install espeak  # On macOS
```

3. (Optional) For GPU acceleration, install PyTorch with CUDA support:
```bash
# For CUDA 11.8
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# For CUDA 12.1
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# For CUDA 12.6
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

# For CUDA 12.8 (for RTX 50-series cards)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

You can verify CUDA support is enabled with:
```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should print True if CUDA is available
```

The system will automatically download required models and voice files on first run.

## Usage

You can use either the command-line interface or the web interface:

### Command Line Interface

Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
python tts_demo.py
```

The CLI provides an interactive menu with the following options:
1. List available voices - Shows all available voice options
2. Generate speech - Interactive process to:
   - Select a voice from the numbered list
   - Enter text to convert to speech
   - Adjust speech speed (0.5-2.0)
3. Exit - Quit the program

Example session:
```
=== Kokoro TTS Menu ===
1. List available voices
2. Generate speech
3. Exit
Select an option (1-3): 2

Available voices:
1. af_alloy
2. af_aoede
3. af_bella
...

Select a voice number (or press Enter for default 'af_bella'): 3

Enter the text you want to convert to speech
(or press Enter for default text)
> Hello, world!

Enter speech speed (0.5-2.0, default 1.0): 1.2

Generating speech for: 'Hello, world!'
Using voice: af_bella
Speed: 1.2x
...
```

### Web Interface

For a more user-friendly experience, launch the web interface:

```bash
python gradio_interface.py
```

Then open your browser to the URL shown in the console (typically http://localhost:7860).

The web interface provides:
- Easy voice selection from a dropdown menu
- Text input field with examples
- Real-time generation progress
- Audio playback in the browser
- Multiple output format options (WAV, MP3, AAC)
- Download options for generated audio

### Dependency Validation

Before running the application, you can validate your system setup:

```bash
python dependency_checker.py
```

This will check:
- Python version compatibility
- All required dependencies and their versions
- CUDA availability and GPU detection
- System memory and disk space
- Audio system functionality

### Configuration Management

The system now includes centralized configuration management:

```python
from config import config

# Get configuration values
sample_rate = config.get("audio.sample_rate")
max_text_length = config.get("limits.max_text_length")

# Set configuration values
config.set("audio.sample_rate", 48000)
config.set("interface.auto_play", True)

# Save configuration
config.save()
```

Configuration files are automatically created with sensible defaults.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Quick System Check

First, run the dependency checker to identify potential issues:
```bash
python dependency_checker.py
```

This will automatically detect and report:
- Missing or incompatible dependencies
- CUDA/GPU configuration issues
- System resource problems
- Audio system issues

### Common Issues

1. **Model Download Issues**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Check Hugging Face is accessible
   - Verify sufficient disk space
   - Try clearing the `.cache/huggingface` directory

2. **CUDA/GPU Issues**
   - Verify CUDA installation with `nvidia-smi`
   - Update GPU drivers
   - Install PyTorch with CUDA support using the appropriate command:
     ```bash
     # For CUDA 11.8
     pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

     # For CUDA 12.1
     pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

     # For CUDA 12.6
     pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

     # For CUDA 12.8 (for RTX 50-series cards)
     pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
     ```
   - Verify CUDA is available in PyTorch:
     ```python
     import torch
     print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should print True
     ```
   - Fall back to CPU if needed

3. **Audio Output Issues**
   - Check system audio settings
   - Verify output directory permissions
   - Install FFmpeg for MP3/AAC support
   - Try different output formats

4. **Voice File Issues**
   - Delete and let system redownload voice files
   - Check `voices/` directory permissions
   - Verify voice file integrity
   - Try using a different voice

5. **Web Interface Issues**
   - Check port 7860 availability
   - Try different browser
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check network firewall settings

For any other issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify all prerequisites are installed
3. Ensure virtual environment is activated
4. Check system resource usage
5. Try reinstalling dependencies
